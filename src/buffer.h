/*
 * The buffer management is a bit strange. We want to try and
 * optimize against several factors - kernel transitions (ie. minimal
 * sends/receives), wasted memory space, minimal allocations/deallocation,
 * fragmentation, minimal byte copies - which are in conflict with
 * each other. Moreover, the netstring format used by the SCGI protocol
 * requires a variable length prefix which is the total length
 * of headers. So we land up using the following scheme -
 *  data[] is an array within the struct, to hold "small" transfers
 *     without needing an extra allocation.
 *  data_used contains actual number of data bytes within data[]
 *  data_off is the offset within data[] where the actual content
 *     begins. This is needed because of the variable length SCGI prefix.
 *     Note data_off should never be more than sizeof(data)
 *  overflowP will be NULL or point to a buffer to hold data that
 *     does not fit in data[]
 *  overflow_sz is the size of the memory area that overflowP points to
 *  total is the total number of bytes in both areas.
 *  mark is an offset that is updated every time memory is reserved
 *     by the application - see buf_reserve and buf_commit.
