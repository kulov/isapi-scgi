A multithreaded, IOCP-based, ISAPI extension for the Simple Common Gateway
Protocol.

The `isapi_scgi` ISAPI extension for Microsoft IIS implements the Simple
Common Gateway Interface (SCGI). SCGI is a standard for communicating
with web servers on the back end. Requests received by IIS are passed
on to the application server over the SCGI protocol and the response
sent back to the client.  Unlike CGI, where the web server will start
a new process for every request, SCGI involves a long-running process
(the SCGI server) which is handed off requests from the web server and
responds as per the protocol. It has the following benefits compared
to CGI:

* It is an order of magnitude or more faster as it avoids all the
  startup costs associated with the latter, such as process creation,
  interpreter initialization, loading of application code and
  re-establishing database connections.

* Because communication with the web server is on top of TCP, the
application code can actually run on a different server if desired for
performance or security reasons.  

This guide describes `isapi_scgi`
installation and usage but assumes you know how to configure your SCGI
application server.

== Features

`isapi_scgi` has the following features:

* Supports Microsoft IIS versions 6, 7 and 8.
* Can optionally start the SCGI application server automatically
* Ability to control parameters like number of threads, outstanding
  IOCP requests etc. for tuning to your particular environment.
* Implemented as an ISAPI C extension and uses I/O completion ports
  for minimal memory and CPU usage
* Supports non-parsed headers
* No other dependencies. Even the C runtime is either not needed
  or is statically bound
* Open source with a liberal BSD license that allows free use even in
  commercial environments.

== Downloading isapi_scgi

The latest version of `isapi_scgi` can be downloaded from the `Files`
section of the 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/isapi-scgi[Sourceforge]
`isapi_scgi` project.
Extract
the files into a temporary folder before following the instructions
for installation.

== Installing isapi_scgi

[IMPORTANT]
The examples and description in this document refer to the extension
DLL as `isapi_scgi.dll` which is the name of the distributed 32-bit DLL.
The distributed 64-bit DLL is called `isapi_scgi64.dll` and when
installing on 64-bit systems, either rename it to `isapi_scgi.dll` or
use `isapi_scgi64.dll` in place of `isapi_scgi.dll` in all instructions
below. Note the configuration file name is always `isapi_scgi.ini`.

`isapi_scgi` is installed like any other ISAPI extension. The sample
sessions below illustrate installation under IIS 6 on Windows XP and
IIS 8 on Windows 8. Installation for other IIS versions are very
similar.

We assume a simple configuration where the extension will be accessed
under `/sandbox/isapi_scgi.dll/`. All requests to URLs below this will
be passed by the extension to the SCGI server. Obviously you may use
techniques such as URL rewriting to hide the use of the DLL but that
is not described here.

=== Installing for IIS 6

Start up the MMC IIS manager and create a new virtual directory,
sandbox, under the default Web site as shown in the screenshot below.

image:mmc_initial.png[]

Right click on the sandbox virtual directory and configure its
properties as shown below.

image:mmc_sandbox_properties.png[]

We have mapped the sandbox virtual directory to a physical directory,
`c:\scgi-example`, on the local system. The important thing to note in
the above configuration screen is that 'Execute Permissions' have been
set to 'Scripts and Executables'. This is required for ISAPI extensions
to be enabled for the virtual directory. Also, setting the 'Application
Protection' value to 'Low' instead of 'Medium' as above will give higher
performance.

Copy the `isapi_scgi.dll` from the temporary directory where you
extracted the distribution into the physical directory,
`c:\scgi-example`, in the above example. The IIS manager console will
look as follows after refreshing.

image:mmc_sandbox_content.png[]

The extension is now installed.

=== Installing for IIS 8

We now illustrate installing `isapi_scgi` for IIS 8, this time using
the 64-bit extension `isapi_scgi64.dll`.

Start up the IIS manager and right-click on the `Default Web Site`
node to bring up the menu.

image:iis8_add_virtual_directory.png[]

Select the `Add Virtual Directory...` menu item and fill the dialog
that comes up as shown.

image:iis8_add_virtual_directory_entry.png[]

We have mapped the sandbox virtual directory to a physical directory,
`c:\scgi-example`, on the local system. 
Copy the `isapi_scgi64.dll` to this physical directory.

Now select the newly created `sandbox` virtual directory node and in the middle
plane double click the `Handler Mappings` item.

image:iis8_sandbox.png[]

This will bring up the handler settings for the `sandbox` virtual directory
as shown below. Note that ISAPI is disabled and needs to be enabled. To
do this, select the `ISAPI-dll` line and click the `Edit Feature Permissions...`
item in the `Actions` pane.

image:iis8_sandbox_handler_mapping.png[]

Fill out the dialog as shown below ensuring all checkboxes are selected.

image:iis8_sandbox_handler_mapping_entry.png[]

On clicking `OK` in the above dialog, you should see `ISAPI-dll` enabled
in the `Handler Mappings` pane for the `sandbox` virtual directory.

image:iis8_sandbox_handler_mapping_enabled.png[]

This is required for ISAPI extensions
to be enabled for the virtual directory.

There is one final step needed. By default, IIS will not allow unknown
extensions to run so we need to add it to the system-wide list of
permitted ISAPI extensions. To do this, select the system node
in IIS Manager and double click the `ISAPI and CGI Restriction` item
in the middle pane.

image:iis8_isapi_restriction.png[]

Click the `Add` item in the `Actions` pane and fill the presented dialog
as below.

image:iis8_isapi_restriction_entry.png[]

Click OK to save the configuration.

The extension is now installed.

=== Final steps

If you are not running the default SCGI server address and port,
follow the steps described in the configuration section to set up
`isapi_scgi` options.

Finally, stop and restart IIS and the default Web site. The `isapi_scgi`
extension will now be invoked whenever a request for a URL beginning
with `/sandbox/isapi_scgi.dll` or `/sandbox/isapi_scgi64.dll` is received
as appropriate.

=== Upgrading from earlier versions

Please note that beginning with Version 0.8, `isapi_scgi` will parse
SCGI response headers by default. This differs from earlier releases
which only supported non-parsed headers operation. To keep the
earlier behaviour, the `NonParsedHeaders` configuration option must be set to
a non-0 value. See <<SCGI response headers>>.

== SCGI request headers

As recommended in the SCGI specification,
`isapi_scgi` passes the following CGI headers to the SCGI server as part
of the request:
`AUTH_TYPE`, `CONTENT_LENGTH`, `CONTENT_TYPE`, `GATEWAY_INTERFACE`,
`PATH_INFO`, `PATH_TRANSLATED`, `QUERY_STRING`, `REMOTE_ADDR`,
`REMOTE_HOST`, `REMOTE_USER`, `REQUEST_METHOD`, `SCRIPT_NAME`,
`SERVER_NAME`, `SERVER_PORT`, `SERVER_PORT_SECURE`,
`SERVER_PROTOCOL` and `SERVER_SOFTWARE`.

In addition, it passes the following protocol specific headers
if they were present in the client request:
`HTTP_CONNECTION`, `HTTP_ACCEPT`, `HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING`,
`HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE`, `HTTP_COOKIE`, `HTTP_HOST`, `HTTP_REFERER`,
`HTTP_USER_AGENT`, `HTTP_UA_CPU` and `HTTPS`.

Please refer to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875[RFC3875]
for the meaning of the above headers.

If any URL rewriters generate the `HTTP_X_ORIGINAL_URL` header,
it is passed as well.

In the case where the request is over an HTTPS connection, the following
additional headers are added:
`HTTPS_KEYSIZE`, `HTTPS_SECRETKEYSIZE`, `HTTPS_SERVER_ISSUER` and
`HTTPS_SERVER_SUBJECT`,
`CERT_COOKIE`, `CERT_FLAGS`, `CERT_ISSUER`, `CERT_KEYSIZE`,
`CERT_SECRETKEYSIZE`, `CERT_SERIALNUMBER`, `CERT_SERVER_ISSUER`,
`CERT_SERVER_SUBJECT` and `CERT_SUBJECT`.

Please refer to the IIS documentation for the meaning of the above headers.

=== Handling custom headers

For the SCGI server to be passed any additional or custom headers, 
they have to be explicitly configured in the `isapi_scgi.ini` 
configuration file. These may be specific to IIS such as
`APPL_MD_PATH`, `APPL_PHYSICAL_PATH`, `AUTH_PASSWORD`,
`AUTH_USER`, `INSTANCE_ID`, `INSTANCE_META_PATH`, `LOCAL_ADDR`,
`LOGON_USER`, `SERVER_PORT_SECURE` and `URL`. They may also
be based on custom HTTP headers sent from the client or generated
by other extensions or filters such as URL rewriters.

To have these headers passed by `isapi_scgi` they must be added as
keys to the `SCGI_HEADER_EXTENSIONS` section of the `isapi_scgi.ini`
configuration file. In the case of custom HTTP headers, the
key is formed by prefixing the actual header name with `HTTP_` and
replacing any `-` characters in the name with `_`. An example section
is shown below:

[source,language="c",subs="verbatim"]
....
[SCGI_HEADER_EXTENSIONS]
INSTANCE_ID= <1> 
HTTP_X_REWRITE_URL= <2>
HTTP_X_CUSTOM_HEADER= <3>
....
<1> Passes the IIS-specific header containing the IIS instance id
<2> Passes the header generated by an installed URL rewriting filter
<3> Passes the X-Custom-Header non-standard header sent by the client

Note that the value assigned to the keys is currently immaterial 
but should be left empty.

== SCGI response headers

The SCGI specification states:

****
When the SCGI server sees the end of the request it sends back a
response and closes the connection. The format of the response is not
specified by this protocol.
****

Two formats for the response are supported by `isapi_scgi` corresponding
to the equivalent CGI specification defined by 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875[RFC3875].

In the normal CGI case, the SCGI server sends a response header
separated from the body by a blank line. The header may contain
a 'Status:' line indicating the HTTP status. If absent, a status
of "200 Ok" is assumed. The `isapi_scgi` extension will then generate
HTTP headers based on the SCGI response headers.

The non-parsed header (NPH) case is enabled when the 
`NonParsedHeaders` configuration setting is set to a non-0 value.
In this case, `isapi_scgi` passes all bytes sent from the SCGI
server back to the client with no modification at all.
The SCGI server is responsible for the entire content passed back
to the client.

See RFC3875 for more details about these behaviours.

== Configuring isapi_scgi

`isapi_scgi` is configured through the `isapi_scgi.ini` file which
must be located in the same directory as the `isapi_scgi.dll`
extension. This file is in the standard Windows INI file format and
may contain the variables described below. These must be defined in
the `[SCGI]` section of the file.

Note that the file is only needed if the defaults described below do
not match your desired configuration.

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]
.Configuration variables
|===
|Variable
|Description
|Default

|`IOCPQueueMax`
|Integer value corresponding to the maximum number of queued IOCP requests.
|50

|`KeepStatistics`
|If non-0, the extension keeps certain statistics that can be useful in troubleshooting or tuning.
|0

|`LogFile`
|Path to the log file.	
|`isapi_scgi.log` in the same directory as `isapi_scgi.dll`.

|`LogLevel`
|Verbosity of logging. 0 turns off, 1 logs only errors.
|1

|`NonParsedHeaders`
|Whether <<_scgi_response_headers, non-parsed headers>> (NPH) are in use. 1 to turn on NPH, 0 to turn off.

|===

The optimal values for `NumThreads` and `IOCPQueueMax` depend on the
system (memory, number of processors and their speed, etc.) and
configuration (for example, whether the SCGI server on a different
system). On heavily loaded systems, you should determine these values
empirically through load testing.

== Starting SCGI servers automatically

You may choose to start your SCGI server automatically and
independently of IIS. Alternatively, you can configure `isapi_scgi` to
start the server automatically when the first request is received and
to shut it down when IIS unloads the extension (for example, when IIS
is shut down).

To have `isapi_scgi` automatically start the SCGI server, set the
configuration variable `SCGIServerStartCommand`. The value must be the
full command including a full path and arguments, if any. `isapi_scgi`
will execute this command without any validation or error
checking. Similarly, to have `isapi_scgi` automatically shut down the
SCGI server, set the configuration variable `SCGIServerStopCommand`. For
example, if your SCGI server runs as the Windows service `myscgiapp`,
you might have the following two lines in the `isapi_scgi` configuration
file:

----
[SCGI]
SCGIServerStartCommand= net start myscgiapp
SCGIServerStopCommand= net stop myscgiapp
----

== Logging in isapi_scgi

By default, `isapi_scgi` will log to the file `isapi_scgi.log` in the same
directory where `isapi_scgi.dll` is located. This can be changed by
setting the `LogFile` variable in the configuration.

The messages logged can be controlled by setting the `LogLevel`. By
default, only errors are logged (`LogLevel=1`). Setting its value to `0`
will turn off all logging and setting it to `2` will log informational
messages as well as errors, including connection requests.
